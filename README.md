# python_practise_worksheet
A collection of Python practice worksheets (by Krish Naik) with my personal solutions. This repository documents my journey of mastering Python through consistent daily problem-solving contributions. Each worksheet focuses on different concepts to strengthen both coding and logical thinking. 

Topics Covered till now: 
1. Basic Syntax (basic_syntax.ipynb).
2. Control flow - loops and conditional statements (control_flow.ipynb).
3. Lists and List Comprehensions (list_Assignment.ipynb)
4. Tuples and their nature with some functions
5. Dictionaries and dict comprehensions
6. Functions (positional + keyword arguments)
7. Functions (lambda + map + filter func + math.ceil() -> to roundoff to nearest larger number)
8. Importing and creating modules in python libraries like:
   (~ maths (sqrt, pi, cos, sin etc mathematical functions)
   ~ random (gives any random variable using random.randint and random.choice)
   ~ os (for file and directory access)
   ~ shutil (for high level operations on files and collection of files)
  ~ json (for data serialization or converting into a string type in easy words)
   ~ array (basic library to let us make arrays)
   ~ csv (to import csv /excel files to work on it)
  ~ datetime (to determine live date and time)
  ~ time (time.sleep(2) used to make the system sleep for 2 seconds)
  ~ re (regular expression; to recognizing patterns and matching them))
9. Making custom Libraries, modules, packages and subpackages using __init__ .py files
10. File Handling (Opening txt and binary files in 'read','write', and 'append' mode.
