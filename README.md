#python_practise_worksheets
A collection of Python practice worksheets (by Krish Naik) with my personal solutions. This repository documents my journey of mastering Python through consistent daily problem-solving contributions. Each worksheet focuses on different concepts to strengthen both coding and logical thinking. 

Topics Covered till now: 
1. Basic Syntax (basic_syntax.ipynb).
2. Control flow - loops and conditional statements (control_flow.ipynb).
3. Lists and List Comprehensions (list_Assignment.ipynb)
4. Tuples and their nature with some functions
5. Dictionaries and dictionary comprehensions
6. Functions (positional + keyword arguments)
7. Functions (lambda + map + filter func + math.ceil() -> to roundoff to nearest larger number)
8. Importing and creating modules in python libraries like -> maths, random, os, shutil, json, array, csv, datetime, time, re
9. Making custom Libraries, modules, packages and subpackages using __init__ .py files
10. File Handling (Opening txt and binary files in 'read','write','append' and 'w+' mode) + using file.seek() to locate to certain position.
11. Exception Handling in python with try, except else and finally blocks.
